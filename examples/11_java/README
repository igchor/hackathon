README

The examples in the workshop folder demonstrate use of LLPL in the context of
some simple data structures.

A_intarray -- a transactional IntArray class
B_anyintarray -- an IntArray class usable with different consistency schemes
C_genericrarray -- an Array<T> class usable with different consistency schemes
D_list -- a linked list class using no object construction when handling nodes
E_recordlog -- a log class demonstrating MemoryPool, coming in the next release of LLPL

Notes:
- the scripts in the scripts folder depend on the JAVA_HOME environment variable
- JAVA_HOME should point to a JDK release, 8 or later
- executing ./scripts/runall will build all examples and run each of them twice
  as a test that everything is working
- examples A-D will run with LLPL master branch or release 1.1 tag; a jar built
  from master is present in base folder
- example E requires an experimental LLPL branch (pool_experiment); a jar built
  from that branch is in the E examples folder and used by the ./scripts/runE script
- the jar files contain both llpl class files and the llpl.so library; extracting
  and loading of the .so is automatic
